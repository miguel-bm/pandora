This zip archive contains ASCII (text) format grids of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per unit area in millions of US dollars derived from the IPCC Emission Scenario data. The ASCII files have a header that lists the number of rows and columns, the X and Y coordinates of the lower-left corner, and the resolution (15 arc-minutes or 1/4 of a degree).

The grids are as follows:
gdp90_15mi.asc	GDP in 1990 (millions of US $, 15 arc-minute resolution)
gdp25_15mi.asc	GDP in 2025 (millions of US $, 15 arc-minute resolution)
